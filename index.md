    <p>
      I am a <strong>PhD student</strong> in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>, where I am a member of the <strong>STACS Lab</strong> advised by Professor Joshua San Miguel.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research focuses on designing novel computer architectures for <strong>energy-efficient edge hardware</strong>, with a specific emphasis on stochastic computing and the development of resilient Networks-on-Chip (NoC) interconnects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previously, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from UW-Madison, where I also completed majors in Data Science and Computer Sciences. My research has been recognized through several honors, including the <strong>Hilldale Undergraduate Research Fellowship</strong> and winning first place at the WiSys Quick Pitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond my doctoral studies, I have gained significant industry experience as a <strong>CPU Hardware Intern at Arm</strong>. During my time there, I worked on formal verification and developed RAG-based LLM pipelines for CPU performance modeling to improve answer accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also deeply involved in the academic community, having served as the President of the IEEE Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) Theta Chapter and as an Undergraduate Student Assistant for courses in computer engineering.
